# PDCA

- an iterative four-step management method used in business for the **control** and **continuous improvements** of **processes and products**
- Alias: Deming circle/cycle/wheel, the Shewhart cycle, the control circle/cycle, or plan–do–study–act (PDSA).

1. **Plan**: Establish the objectives and processes required to deliver the desired results.
2. Do: The do phase allows the plan from the previous step to be done. Small changes are usually tested, and data is gathered to see how effective the change is.
3. **Check**:
   1. Evaluate the data and results gathered from the do phase
      1. Data are compared to the outcomes to see any similarities and differences.
   2. Evaluate the testing process to see if there were any changes from the original test created during the planning phase
   3. If the data is placed in a chart it can make it easier to see any trends if the PDCA cycle is conducted multiple times.
      1. This help to see what changes work better than others, and if said changes can be improved as well.
4. **Act**:
   1. Also called "Adjust"
   2. This is where a process is improved.
      1. Records from the "do" and "checK" phases help identify issues with the process.
         1. These issues may include problems, non-conformities, opportunities for improvement, inefficiencies, and other issues that result in outcomes that are evidently less-than-optimal.
      2. Modify the process to investigate, find and eliminate the root causes of such issues.
      3. Re-evaluated risk.
   3. At the end of the actions in this phase, the process has better instructions, standards or goals.
      1. Planning for the next cycle can proceed with a better base-line.
         1. Work in the next do phase should not create a recurrence of the identified issues; if it does, then the action was not effective.
